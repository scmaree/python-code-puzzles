# Pyzzle
A collection of Python code snippets and scripts I use when solving python coding puzzles and other nerdy things.
I tried my best to include references to the sources of code snippets, but I might have missed some,
so just let me know.

pip install pyzzle @ git+https://github.com/scmaree/pyzzle
```
